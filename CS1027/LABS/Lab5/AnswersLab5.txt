EXERCISE 2
----------

What line of the program causes the exception to be thrown?
line 8 of the program is causing the exception to be thrown.

Why did testArray[0][0] not change?
because the nested for loop starts at j = 1; so the array at [0][0] will never be accessed by the loop, so the value didn't change.

After pressing F6 until testArray[0][5] changes value from 0 to 5 and the statement for (int j=1; j<=6; j++) is highlighted in green,
    - what are the values of i and j?
	i = 0; j = 6

	- is it correct that the program tries to store the value (i+1)*j in testArray[i][j]?
	the nested arrays in testArray are of length 6, meaning the highest index value is 5. So if j = 6 the array can't be accessed at [i][i] because there is not 6th index value in testArray[i].
EXERCISE 3
----------

Which line of the program causes the exception to be thrown?
line 10 of the program causes the exception to be thrown because load is 0 and the code tries to divide by load.

Which line is highligted after pressing F6?
line 10 is highlighted

After re-running the program which line is highligter after pressing F5?
line 18

What is the differentce between F5 and F6?
F5 steps into the function in the current line; F6 doesn't step into the function and instead steps over it right to the next line.

What are the values of variables i, step, result and Load?
i: 4
step: -468
result: 472
load:  0

Why does the progam crash after pressing F6?
because we are trying to divide by load, but load is 0 so a zero division error is thrown.

EXERCISE 4
----------

Why is there a compilation error in line 27?
there is an error in line 27 because i has not been declared.
a variable i is declared in the for loop, but the scope of that variable means that it only exists inside the loop so it cannot be used outside the loop.

What do you think will be the values of variables var1 and obj1 immediately after method2(obj1) is executed?
var1 = -20
obj1 = MyObject("john")


What do you think will be the values of variables var1 and obj1 immediately after method1(obj1) is executed?
var1 = -20
obj1 = MyObject("john")

What are the correct values of variables var1 and obj1 immediately after method2(obj1) is executed?
var1 = -20
obj1 = MyObject("john")

Why is the result of the comparison (obj1 == obj2) false even though both obj1 and obj2 contain the same information, namely "joe"? 
its because obj1 and obj2 are held at different locaitons in memory, so they are not the same object, so the comparison returns false.
