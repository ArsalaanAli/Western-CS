Answers for Lab 9
-----------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 1

1. What are the values of x, arr[0], and arr[1] in lines 20, 24, and 27 of MemoryDemo.java?
x = 2
arr[0] = 3
arr[1] = 6

2. If the value of x set in line 18 did not change in method m1 explain why.
The scope of x inside the function is local because it is a primitive variable, meaning x inside the function does not point to the same global integer, so the function does not change the global value of x.

3. Explain which of arr[0] or arr[1] were changed in methods m2() or m3() and why these values were changed.
arr[0] was changed because in m2() the array is passed through as an argument because the array is a reference variable, so the changes point to the actual array itself, in m3() an integer is passed through so the changes don't take place.
